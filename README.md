# A Perfectly Symmetric Keyboard Layout
I have probably tried more keyboard layouts than most keyboard enthusiasts even know exist. And to answer your question, no. There is no superior layout. There is no single layout better than the rest. Everyone is different, physically different. I for one have ridiculously small pinky fingers making 10 finger typing on Qwerty a royal pain in the ass. So this is layout is designed for me by me. Hence why there's a big chance you'll not find it suitable for you. Same with any other layout be it workman, colemak, norman etc. If you're going to put in the effort to learn a new layout, especially something with a learning curve as dvorak. Then you're better off using a layout like BEAKL15 and updating it to suit your needs.
